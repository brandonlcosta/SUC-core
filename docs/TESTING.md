### 🎯 Mandate

Testing validates SUC’s integrity — harnesses prove every system works and surface trust as a brand signal.

### 🔑 Integration Points

* **Timing Harness** → validates pacing cadence.
* **Vibe Harness** → validates vibe\_score rise/decay.
* **Replay Harness** → deterministic event log → replay equivalence.
* **Greenboard Harness** → unified ✅/❌ scoreboard for all engines.

### 💡 Innovation Bets

* Testing = brand moat (Proof of Integrity).
* Greenboard visible in HUD/broadcast → SUC Certified badge.
* Harness results drive public trust, not just QA.

### 🚀 Ultra Contributions

* Ultra 001 → Timing + Vibe harness online.
* Ultra 002 → Greenboard integrated into Studio.
* Ultra 004 → Replay harness productized.
